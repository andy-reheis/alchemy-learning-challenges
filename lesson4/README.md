# nft-viewer

This is a simple next.js app to view NFT owned by a wallet address (eg.: 0x0348AE5325585cDf260A6D23476c603136DfBf24)
Instead of the wallet address a collection name can be provided as well.

For this app to work on your computer, you need to have an account on alchemy.com, create a app on the Ethereum Mainnet and insert your API-KEY in index.jsx line 13 + line 42.
